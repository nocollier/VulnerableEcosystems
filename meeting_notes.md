# Meeting Notes

## 2020/10/12

* Jitu/Nate will pursue climate driver clustering, Jitu already has
  some work done on this
* Moet/Deeksha/Min will begin an evaluation of temperature and
  precipitation extremes of CMIP6 models
  - Some of this evaluation they have done in another context, hoping
    that the assessment gives us some direction
  - Nate will run ILAMB through the CMIP6 models available to give us
    an idea of what is out there
* We will target OLCF for now. Current allocations there will allow us
  to work via Rhea and we can write a DD for a formal allocation, Nate
  will look into this.
* Visualizations shown via Dash/Plotly are good, could also look at
  Holoviews/Geoviews
  - For requirements for serving up the apps, could ask Sarat
* The Next Big Thing (NBT) is an effort that many in ESD area already
  involved in, responsible for working with Stan to get the Vulnerable
  Ecosystems language in the LDRD call in the first place. They are a
  good group to engage to help get feedback.
  - Giving them a project overview on Nov 13, any results we can piece
    together is an opportunity for feedback
