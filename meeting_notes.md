# Meeting Notes

## 2020/11/6

### Visualization Feedback

* Contribution plots should be in terms of areas
* The entire visualization needs more labeling
* Coloring should be made consisitent
* Needs more linkage, fade the map when things are selected
* Could we use the size of the markers in the parametric plots to
  indicate something, perhaps area contribution at the given time
  indicated? Or it could be the within-cluster variance
* Need a view which shows things from a single cluster point of view
  as well. What are the distributions of values in a cluster? At what
  times do we see the clusters?
* We want to keep the time range back to 1850 even if we later only
  show vulnerability across a range in the modern era. This is to
  better understand what has changed and define regions in their
  historical context

* Jitu/Nate will pursue climate driver clustering, Jitu already has
  some work done on this
* Moet/Deeksha/Min will begin an evaluation of temperature and
  precipitation extremes of CMIP6 models
  - Some of this evaluation they have done in another context, hoping
    that the assessment gives us some direction
  - Nate will run ILAMB through the CMIP6 models available to give us
    an idea of what is out there
* We will target OLCF for now. Current allocations there will allow us
  to work via Rhea and we can write a DD for a formal allocation, Nate
  will look into this.
* Visualizations shown via Dash/Plotly are good, could also look at
  Holoviews/Geoviews
  - For requirements for serving up the apps, could ask Sarat
* The Next Big Thing (NBT) is an effort that many in ESD area already
  involved in, responsible for working with Stan to get the Vulnerable
  Ecosystems language in the LDRD call in the first place. They are a
  good group to engage to help get feedback.
  - Giving them a project overview on Nov 13, any results we can piece
    together is an opportunity for feedback
